Download:            37 MB/s (100MB file)
Failure Detection:   30 seconds
Recovery:            45 seconds (replication)

File Sizes:          1KB - 500MB

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
-------------------------
Language:            Python 3.11+
Framework:           Flask (REST API)
Database:            SQLite (metadata)
Hashing:             SHA-256 (integrity)
Architecture:        Master-Worker pattern
Distribution:        Round-Robin (primary)
Fault Tolerance:     Replication + Erasure Coding
Communication:       HTTP/REST

INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS:
----------------------
1. Adaptive strategy selection (file-size based)
2. Lightweight metadata (10MB vs HDFS 64GB)
3. Orbital-aware design (power, latency considerations)
4. Hybrid fault tolerance (replication + EC)

RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
--------------------
- Ghemawat et al. (2003): Google File System
- Plank & Xu (2006): Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding
- Chandra & Toueg (1996): Failure Detectors
- Denby & Lucia (2020): Orbital Edge Computing

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
1. Extract all files maintaining structure
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python src/main.py --mode demo
4. View logs for step-by-step execution

DEMO FLOW:
----------
1. Initialize 8 satellite nodes
2. Upload 10MB test file
3. Shard into 10 chunks (1MB each)
4. Distribute via round-robin
5. Simulate node failure (kill sat_02)
6. Wait for detection (30s)
7. Download and reconstruct
8. Verify integrity (SHA-256)
Result: ✅ Perfect match despite failure

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------
⚠️ Master SPOF (backup manual failover only)
⚠️ Localhost simulation (not networked)
⚠️ No Byzantine fault tolerance
⚠️ Limited to 8GB files (memory constraint)

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
--------------------
- Raft consensus for master failover
- Docker deployment
- Raspberry Pi benchmarks
- Academic paper publication
