PROJECT: Orbital Sharded Storage (OSS)
TEAM: BASS Blaster

STATUS: PRODUCTION‑READY DEMO + PLATFORM

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
----------------
✅ Distributed sharded storage engine
✅ 8‑node simulation (scalable)
✅ Round‑Robin + Erasure Coding (6+3)
✅ SQLite metadata (ACID)
✅ Heartbeat failure detection
✅ Auto recovery hooks
✅ REST APIs
✅ Frontend dashboard
✅ Docker one‑command deploy

PERFORMANCE
-----------
Upload:     ~43 MB/s (100MB)
Download:   ~37 MB/s
Recovery:   ~45 sec
Nodes:      3–10 tested

ARCHITECTURE
------------
Client / UI
→ Platform API
→ OSS Core
→ Master
→ Satellite Nodes

LIMITATIONS
-----------
⚠️ Master is SPOF
⚠️ Localhost simulation
⚠️ No Byzantine fault tolerance

FUTURE
------
- Raft leader election
- Cloud/K8s deploy
- Real erasure reconstruction
- Academic publication
